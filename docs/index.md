# Introduction

![](./static/sdk-hero.png)

## Description

A simple package that allows you to write your API integrations or SDKs in a elegant way.

## Why?

Building API integrations can be time consuming. After you have found an API client to use, you’re faced with lots of configuration to remember and it’s hard to repeat requests without copying and pasting. You’ll often find yourself writing the same boilerplate code over and over again.

While we have provided tools to work with APIs from [PSR-7](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7), [PSR-17](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-17) and [PSR-18](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-18), we do not currently have a standardized structure for building API integrations.

## Features

- Provides a simple, easy-to-learn, object-oriented syntax that standardizes the way you interact with APIs.
- Abstract API integrations into classes so you can keep your tidy and centralized.
- Configuration is fast and can be shared across all your requests.
- [PSR](https://www.php-fig.org/psr) compliant.
- HTTP Client agnostic.
- Great for building your next PHP SDKs or package/library
- Scalable with lots of API integrations across many team members.
