# Introduction

![](./static/sdk-hero.png)

## Description

A simple package that allows you to write your API integrations or SDKs in a elegant way.

## Why?

Building API integrations can be time consuming. After you have found an API client to use, you’re faced with lots of configuration to remember and it’s hard to repeat requests without copying and pasting. You’ll often find yourself writing the same boilerplate code over and over again.

We’ve standardised the way we talk to APIs with [PSR-7](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7), [PSR-17](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-17) and [PSR-18](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-18) but we haven’t got a standard structure to build API integrations.

## Features

- Simple, easy to learn syntax that standardises the way you interact with APIs
- Abstract API integrations into classes so you can keep your code DRY
- Configuration is fast and can be shared across all your requests
- [PSR](https://www.php-fig.org/psr) compliant.
- HTTP Client agnostic
- Great for building your own PHP SDKs
- Scalable with lots of API integrations across many team members
