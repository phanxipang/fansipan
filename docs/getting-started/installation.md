You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require fansipan/fansipan
```

You should have at least one package that offers implementation for [PSR-7, PSR-17 and PSR-18](./requirements.md). Here are a few recommendations:

- [Guzzle](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle) 路 PSR-7, PSR-17 and PSR-18
- [Symfony HTTP Client](https://symfony.com/doc/current/http_client.html#psr-18-and-psr-17) 路 PSR-17 and PSR-18
- [nyholm/psr7](https://github.com/Nyholm/psr7) 路 PSR-7 and PSR-17
- [Buzz](https://github.com/kriswallsmith/buzz) 路 PSR-18

```bash
composer require guzzlehttp/guzzle
```
