You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require jenky/atlas
```

You should have at least a package that provides [PSR-7, PSR-17 and PSR-18 implementation](./requirements.md). Here are few suggestions:

- [Guzzle](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle) · PSR-7, PSR-17 and PSR-18
- [Symfony HTTP Client](https://symfony.com/doc/current/http_client.html#psr-18-and-psr-17) · PSR-17 and PSR-18
- [nyholm/psr7](https://github.com/Nyholm/psr7) · PSR-7 and PSR-17
- [Buzz](https://github.com/kriswallsmith/buzz) · PSR-18

```bash
composer require guzzlehttp/guzzle
```
